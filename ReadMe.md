# Pyneal -- real-time fMRI Analysis Software
*updated: 7/2016*

*NOTE:* The current software was built specifically for the scanning environment at Duke University. Over the next few months the code will be adapted to suit more general usage. Along those same lines, the documentation is very much a work in progress. A new software version and complete documentation is anticipated to be released by late summer or early fall 2016. Until then, use with caution.
